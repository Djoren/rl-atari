# Atari 2600 Deep-Q Learning AI
Rf-atari implements a set of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn control policies for playing Atari games.
This implementation recreates the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) model and configuration as proposed first by Google DeepMind.
The following deep-RL variants and features are built out, the integrated combination of which is known as the Rainbow agent.
